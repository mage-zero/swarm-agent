The old tag-only precheck could bypass cloud-swarm's image-label/base-digest rebuild invalidation and leave stale base images (for example an old mz-php-fpm entrypoint) in use during Magento image rebuilds. The legacy behavior remains available by explicitly setting MZ_DEPLOY_SKIP_SERVICE_BUILD_IF_PRESENT=1.",

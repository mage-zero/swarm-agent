If the schema is still reported as 'not up to date' (e.g. due to a buggy third-party module db_schema.xml), record a marker. Subsequent deploys with the same artifact skip the upgrade cycle (no maintenance mode, no DB backup, no setup:upgrade), saving ~4 minutes per deploy and avoiding unnecessary downtime.",
